# Department of Defense Service Contract Spending Explorer
This project is a Streamlit app that uses data from USAspending to generate interactive visualizations to explore the Department of Defense’s spending on service contracts over time. Visualizing trends in this spending can demonstrate opportunities to implement category management, a best procurement practice encouraged by GAO, GSA, and OMB to consolidate contracts within core spending categories across an enterprise. By interacting with plots of DoD’s contract spending broken down across various categories and classifications, users can further their understanding not only of how DoD compares to other agencies, but what areas offer the most potential to implement category management efforts.
